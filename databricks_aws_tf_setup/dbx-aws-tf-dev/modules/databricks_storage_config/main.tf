/**
 * Databricks Storage Configuration Module
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Creates TWO account-level configurations required for workspace deployment:
 * 1. Storage Configuration - Links S3 bucket to Databricks account
 * 2. Credentials Configuration - Links IAM role to Databricks account (for EC2 provisioning)
 *
 * These correspond to:
 * - "Create a storage configuration" (Databricks docs Step 1-4)
 * - "Create a credential configuration" (Databricks docs Step 1-3)
 *
 * Prerequisites (must be completed):
 * - S3 bucket created with proper bucket policy
 * - IAM role created with Databricks trust policy (arn:aws:iam::414351767826:root)
 * - IAM policies attached (Unity Catalog S3/KMS/STS + Cross-account EC2 + File Events)
 *
 * Note: Both resources use the SAME IAM role, which has permissions for:
 * - Unity Catalog storage access (S3, KMS)
 * - Workspace compute provisioning (EC2)
 *
 *
 * Cost: $0/month (configuration metadata only, no infrastructure costs)
