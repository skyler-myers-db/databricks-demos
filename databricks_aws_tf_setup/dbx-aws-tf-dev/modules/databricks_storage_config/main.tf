/**
 * Databricks Storage Configuration Module (Step 4)
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Registers S3 bucket and IAM role with Databricks account for workspace creation.
 * This creates a storage configuration that can be referenced during workspace provisioning.
 *
 * Prerequisites (must be completed):
 * - Step 1: S3 bucket created with proper bucket policy
 * - Step 2: IAM role created with Databricks trust policy
 * - Step 3: IAM policies attached (S3, KMS, STS, file events)
 *
 * Databricks API/Provider Details:
 * - Resource: databricks_mws_storage_configurations
 * - Scope: Account-level configuration
 * - Purpose: Associates AWS resources with Databricks account
 *
 * Databricks Documentation:
 * https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/storage.html
 *
 * Cost: $0/month (configuration metadata only, no infrastructure costs)
